# Full stack to-do-list application (PERN stack) 
Decided to try to implement a full-stack version of the to-do-list react app I created a few weeks back. 
I mainly used React.JS for the client-side development and ExpressJS/PostgreSQL for the back-end. 

These are some resources that I referred to for both deployment and code structure:
